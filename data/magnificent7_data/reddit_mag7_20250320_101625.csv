Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1ee9goi,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023: - The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion. - The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads. - Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue. Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads. Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing. Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT. TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline. Not a finacial advice",Rauf_KB,0,2024-07-28 11:03:33,110,"[""All this was said at $100. And again at $140. I didn't hear any complaints at $190. But here we go again at $170.

This could lead to short-term buying pressure on GOOGL. 2. Speculation on Future Catalysts: Pelosi’s stock trades have historically sparked speculation about potential government policies or insider knowledge. Investors might anticipate upcoming favorable developments for Google (e.g., regulatory decisions, AI advancements). 3.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1eriwi8,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations. The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said. The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request. Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment. The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s. Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results. **Breakup** Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store. Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found. Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.” Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc. Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial. If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said. **Data Access** Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively. Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds. Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents. In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other. **AI Products** For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI. Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web. Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews. While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win",Fidler_2K,3313,2024-08-13 17:03:15,597,"['When the DOJ Googles what to do in this situation, Google will inform the DOJ to let Google be.

And let me tell you, it's not a pretty story. During his time at Yahoo, the company's search market share PLUMMETED from 30.4% to 13.4%. Yeah, you read that right - it was a FREE FALL. And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better. Under his leadership, Yahoo's search market share DECLINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. And to top it all off, Yahoo had its LARGEST LAYOFFS IN CORPORATE HISTORY at the time, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs. Is this a risk to GOOG long-term healthy growth? Have they started prioritizing short-term ad revenue over user experience, flooding search results with spam and ads to inflate earnings?

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1ar26eu,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring. Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value. The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products. Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market. Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT. Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products. Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1f5ivu1,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta. 2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price. 5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up. 6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",DanielBeuthner,860,2024-08-31 04:54:12,480,"['[deleted]', 'Not knocking your plan, but I will say that any strategy that starts with “l’m all-in on…..” immediately means it’s not what I’d call a strategy.

Earnings per share (EPS): $1.21 vs $1.28 expected, according to Refinitiv Revenue: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected, according to Refinitiv Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the Alphabet report: YouTube advertising revenue: $7.52 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Google Cloud revenue: $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Alphabet is expected to report a slowing of revenue growth to 13% from 62% a year earlier, when the company was pulling out of the pandemic and the economy was flourishing. Recently, analysts have lowered their estimates for second-quarter earnings to account for broad economic challenges now facing advertisers. Google said last month it will slow the pace of hiring and investments through 2023, and CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo, “we’re not immune to economic headwinds.” “We need to be more entrepreneurial working with greater urgency, sharper focus, and more hunger than we’ve shown on sunnier days,” Pichai wrote. Also during the quarter, Google said it would be raising pay and overhauling its performance evaluation system for full-time employees as the company tries to ease tension between employees and leadership. Alphabet finance chief Ruth Porat warned Wall Street in April that the company may be in for another rough quarter after missing analysts expectations on the top and bottom lines for the first period. She cited the Russia-Ukraine war, tough comparisons from the prior year’s growth and competition from rivals like TikTok. Snap soured the mood for ad-tech last week, when the social media company reported disappointing results on the top and bottom line and said “forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.” The stock plunged 39% and pulled down other ad-tech stocks. Facebook parent Meta, which is set to report results on Wednesday, dropped more than 7%. There’s also potential regulatory action from lawmakers related to Google’s dominant search business.

It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year. Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,” CEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.” **Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes** 1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are “increasingly choosing Duet AI” to “boost productivity and improve their operations.” This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google’s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google Cloud ""is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini” to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration, 2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1ibkcex,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history. The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.” The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.” But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion. Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%. For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020. Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix. CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list. The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China. Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety. “I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote. Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1eanere,Alphabet to invest $5 billion in self-driving car unit Waymo,"Alphabet is again investing in its self-driving car unit Waymo — this time with $5 billion. “This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving company,” Alphabet’s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, adding Waymo is an “important example” of Alphabet’s long-standing investments. Porat announced the “multiyear” investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company’s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, expected on Wednesday. Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit, which includes Waymo, delivered $365 million in quarterly revenue, up from $285 million a year ago. But the unit’s losses widened to $1.13 billion from $813 million in the year-earlier period. CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call that Waymo provides 50,000 weekly paid trips, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June, Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users. The unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company and more. Alphabet’s increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from August to Oct. 10. “Alphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo,” Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. “We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we’ve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts.” Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/alphabet-to-invest-5-billion-in-self-driving-car-unit-waymo.html",Puginator,604,2024-07-23 20:09:17,191,"[""Welcome to r/stocks!

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1ggjotg,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago. Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy. I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins. Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons. * It has a near monopoly in Search * Market leadership in media with YouTube. * A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo. * A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS. **Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.** Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings. Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.** Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%. Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business. Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads. **Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.** Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months. Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more. Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21! I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation. Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin. The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision. **I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",Fountainheadusa,327,2024-10-31 13:13:27,166,"['The down move after earnings is due to market movement as well as OPENai releasing a “search engine”.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,10hueqy,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%. The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy. Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him. From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity. The China Worry Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China. While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China. The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple. Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand."" In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term. All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally. A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost. A Robust Product Pipeline Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ. Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year. This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company. Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream. History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism. In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can. A Compelling Valuation Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA. Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever. Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead. Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target. Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside. Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year? We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter. In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business. Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon. It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red). Apple really is that good. The Bottom Line In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors. Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation. Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared. Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023. There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point. We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",msaleem,1194,2023-01-21 10:59:50,204,"['The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.', ""The question around Apple is how can it maintain high growth if it has become so big?

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1fy93q7,Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises. The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers. Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race. Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",Guy_PCS,188,2024-10-07 10:33:26,258,"['I just came back from San Francisco where I took waymo everywhere.

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1dbvyv3,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue. With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch. But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift. Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo. Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",Think_Ad8198,284,2024-06-09 11:11:21,245,"['I might have believed your bearish prediction if I didn’t know Google’s infrastructure and ecosystem.', "">If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results?

Reddit,GOOGL,Alphabet,1bnaa9e,"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law","The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation. “Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement. The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store. “The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday. Apple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app. The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services. The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine. The Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.” The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA. “The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.” Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU. “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.

Reddit,AMZN,Amazon,1b8a3n8,The downfall of Amazon $AMZN has started.,"Investors and consumers need to know this very important fact about Amazon (Marketplace). They just dug their own grave. Third party sellers make up about 65% of the sales generated on Amazon and recently they did a dirty move to third sellers that will have many leaving the platform or raising prices so high that Amazon becomes uncompetitive to consumers. Amazon just announced/implemented two new double-dip fees that will crush third party sellers and that's not even an exaggeration. The first fee which has been implemented already is an ""inbound placement fee"" which is a shipping fee Amazon tacks on to send inventory to Amazon ""Prime"" for Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This fee has increased the shipping cost for third party sellers by 6-10x. For example, a seller sending a truckload of inventory (prior to this inbound placement fee) to Amazon traditionally spent about $600-$800, sometimes way more. Now on top of this they are charged with the inbound placement fee of about $3,000-$5,000. This essentially wipes out a huge chunk, if not most, of the profit margin for a seller on Amazon. Add in the additional fees Amazon charges: 15% referral fee (just to list on their site), 8-15% fulfillment fee (FBA; picking, packing and delivery), storage fees (around $0.78 per cubic foot) and advertising costs (about 2-15% of the price of each good depending on the market). The second fee which will take place in about a month is a ""low inventory fee"" which is a fee imposed by the Amazon algorithm when inventory is starting to run low at Amazon fulfillment centers. This fee can be anywhere from $0.32-$1.11 PER ITEM. The kicker is that the Amazon fulfillment center receiving process is a huge cluster fuck that can take 30+ days to inbound and check-in from when the Seller ships it. That is, if Amazon doesn't lose or damage the goods at the warehouse OR during delivery. So by the time Amazon ships a product out to a customer, they have essentially pocketed about 60% of the sale. When you take out the cost of the good for the seller, that leaves them with very little profit margin, if any. The margins were already razor thin before these rate hikes and now they are all but gone. Why is this important to investors and customers? The only solution for third party sellers to barely keep their head above the water and maintain a remote semblance of their razor thin margins prior to the new fees is to raise prices. I'm talking 20-30% price increases are required at a minimum just to get back to par. You want to talk about all the issues with inflation well, now you know, corporate greed is being shown at its finest. Amazon reported a $30.4 billion net income for 2023 but will penny pinch third party sellers even more at the expense of driving prices up for consumers like never before seen on the platform. This will cause consumers to look elsewhere to shop other than Amazon because Amazon will now be highly uncompetitive. It's just a matter of time. Amazon shot themselves in the foot and needs to reverse course on these absurd fees. PUTS ON $AMZN [ADD] Wow this post blew up! While I have your attention, remember when you get a damaged or wrong product from Amazon, don’t go leaving a 1-star negative review because that just screws over the seller who had nothing to do with the transaction. It’s 100% Amazon’s fault and leaving a negative review is a shit thing to do. Contact customer service instead and yell at them. On that note, if a seller reaches out and makes things right, leave a good review or edit the bad review you left.

From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale. One of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more—making it a must-have for millions of households globally. A recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon’s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it’s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon’s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space. Looking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative—not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem.

Reddit,AMZN,Amazon,o00qva,"Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.","Hello, ""Apes"". it is I...also....ape. Yes, ape. Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you. Or something. We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape.... &#x200B; Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard. This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor. &#x200B; Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is. So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information. So let's talk about it: &#x200B; # What's the deal: &#x200B; In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide. This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them. In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel. To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49, to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years. That represents about 27% of the company. But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that. I mean, obviously. &#x200B; The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once. That happened today. The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it. Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise. Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today. I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know. It must be because I am not a smart ape like you. Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn. &#x200B; # Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part: &#x200B; Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point. If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company. This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant. Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers. Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible. Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well. And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"". You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts. &#x200B; # Why does any of this matter? &#x200B; Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this: If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling. The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards. The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory SELLING is. And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money. Confusing, I know. I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46. &#x200B; So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it. Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape? &#x200B; TL:DR: Bezos is smart ape. And you are clearly smart ape. Smart apes hang out with each other. This is just like being Bezos. Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares. Poor Jeff can't.

Reddit,AMZN,Amazon,qlb35d,Yo seriously. What the shit would Tesla even need to do for profit in order to even justify it's current valuation???? 1.2t market cap. Amazon is at 1.7t and the most profitable car company rn is Toyota at 300b .......???,"Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... I've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... If Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . Look I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that. Edit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. It's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation. But my money is on this. Edit 2: reading many of the comments , it seems like alot of people are confused that there's actually a difference between company and stock. Saying that Tesla is a growth stock (disregarding it's current market cap), just because the company is still growing is essentially the gist of many responses. While Not realizing it's already priced in on a veeeerry optimistic note at that. Also do people ever stop to think how the hell is this dude gonna monopolize all these different areas of innovation? Amazon focused on 1 thing only , it took them 2decades to reach 1.7t. and monopolize that one thing . honestly , the ideas are decent ,but what about execution? People invest like all his ideas are already at monopoly level. Battery grid, EV cars, AI, spaceX , renewable energy, solar, boring company tunnels, internet grid, something about monkeys , And many more projects. I've heard the argument that Tesla is ""not a car company"" to justify it's current valuation. Like somehow this dude is going to monopolize all these different fields. Ironically If anything EV cars is where he'll most likely have a Monopoly. Saying Tesla is a growth stock just because the company is still growing while it's already at 1.2t marker cap, is the same as saying GME is a growth stock during MOASS when it's market cap is quadrillions . Just bc "" the company is still growing it hasn't implemented NFTs yet"" . Edit 3: Also y'all remember when Tesla double in market cap, AKA double it's company's worth (for those who don't understand market cap) ,just because musk boy said ""5/1 split"" 😂😂😂 yo this stock is surreal. Any other company with these kinds of specs , it'll be a no brainer to short. Puts all the way! Not Tesla. Hell fucking no. You think I'm gonna bet against a stock where the company double in valuation just because ""oOoOO it's ""cheap"" now!"" --- (P.S you actually paid more for a smaller piece.) you outa yo goddamn mind if you think I'm gonna go against this kind of retard strength!

AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions. AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions. An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner. Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers. ""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form."" Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day. Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region. ""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia."" AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year. ""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added. Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations. Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses. The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan. ""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand."" Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.",_hiddenscout,1189,2024-10-16 09:29:23,233,"[""Welcome to r/stocks!

The cuts are on top of the previously announced layoffs that began in November and extended into January. That round affected more than 18,000 employees. Amazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs and took into account the uncertain economy, as well as the “uncertainty that exists in the near future,” Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as “OP2.” “The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole,” Jassy said.

Reddit,AAPL,Apple,1iej3mb,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares. I bought 1200 dollars worth. In early 2000, I had just graduated college. I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker. I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase. Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs. I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs. He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X. These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power. And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit. I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple. `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. And…. it came tumbling down in April 2000. Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months. When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back. Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now? And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it. Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits. • 2-for-1 split in 2000 • 2-for-1 split in 2005 • 7-for-1 split in 2014 • 4-for-1 split in 2020 Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents. As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today. The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant. It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them. I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children. Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition. I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",leontes,987,2025-01-31 11:46:00,139,"['$1200 originally invested with 26,527.62% rate of return is $318,331.44 But as you say you have invested much more all throughout the years, so congrats!', 'The number one lesson I’ve seen and learned the hard way over time is never sell.

Reddit,AAPL,Apple,1bk7xgd,DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers. Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings. “Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit. The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services. The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand. The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue. “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release. Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.” The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries. “This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said. iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple. Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer. “Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event. “Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded. The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint. The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta. Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law. “Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release. The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download. Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app. Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

Reddit,AAPL,Apple,1ciq1fw,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10%,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization. Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter. Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion. Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. “If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat. Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March. Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines. “We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line. Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June. Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions. Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei. “I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said. In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1eca49y,I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take: I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year. The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away. Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell. In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either. I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg) EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications: 1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year. 2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip. 3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels. There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1i6jjup,Meta: this sub seems dead and I think both users and mods are at fault,"This will most likely get removed as well. But as a long time contributor on this sub I want to vent a little. What’s the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn’t post financial news by itself since they are “low effort posts”, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared. But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are “just buy index funds” regardless of what the questions are. Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive “you have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO” or no response at all. So we can’t post financial news by themselves, and this isn’t the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to “buy index funds”. Btw mods, I understand that you guys don’t want “low-effort posts”, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it’s ok to leave it up? It’s not like the front page is full anyway. It’s frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. Edit: Honestly I’ll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I’m not sure the mods are willing to spend time on. I’ve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers. There are better places than Reddit for small, closed off communities with high barrier of entry.

There used to be a lot of posts on individual stocks. They were long form and showed a degree of deep thought and analysis. Equally, the people replying appeared to have reasoned replies as opposed to news based ones. Search for the tepco posts to see what those discussions often looked like. Obviously not everyone (even most) who posted or replied behaved this way but there were enough of them. There are tonnes more Redditors on this sub now and while I doubt the percent of posters who ask questions that have been answered a million times before or make the “VOO and chill” reply, has changed by much, there are more such posts. 5% of 1 million is larger than 5% of 100,000 ya know. The industry has changed. ETFs are better known and more diverse. One reason we used to have more posts about individual stocks was because users were looking for exposure to market niches and didn’t have an ETF for that exposure. Now you can just buy an ETF and doing so is probably the best option for an investor. OPs don’t seem to engage the same way but I could be wrong as I myself don’t post/reply much any more. Finally, the mods, at least in my view, banned a lot more people before. Maybe what we need is a rule that says your first post must be substantive and an opinion, not a question. And you can’t comment until you post.', 'Eh. True investing is boring.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1iickrt,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026. I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income). Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony. The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting). The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve. In fact it will probably get worse. I can see Google tripling profits between now and 2030 while the p/e is cut in half, tbh Imagine telling a Google bear on the eve of November 2022 after the release of ChatGPT that Google will make 100b in net income in 2024. They'd laugh in your face - search will be obsolete by then. The jury is out on this one, generative AI is not taking marker share and not causing a growth slowdown. We've been asking this question for almost 3 years now, the answer has remained the same, yet bears keep on thinking that will change. When do you bears lose credibility? We've been hearing about the demise of Search for almost 30 months. At what point do you just admit that you're wrong and realize that LLM is orthogonal to search? what are peoples thoughts? EDIT: A commentor posted this: ""google will never have half the PE of now, it cannot trade at average SPY PE, it has too much moat to be valued like any other SPY company"" Yet look at the facts today: Current p/e ratio of the SPY: 27.71 current p/e ratio of GOOG: 21 - so google already trades at a STEEP discount to the market. I'm looking at the P/E chart and it seems that the discount is poised to just get worse over time? Pull up the chart of GOOG P/E over time, its in terminal decline for years now. It started the decade around ~30, halfway through the decade in 2025 its at ~21, it will be 10-15 by end of the decade at this rate why is GOOG considered ""magnificent"" (the market thinks the business is lackluster considering the steep discount it trades at)?",AverageUnited3237,943,2025-02-05 10:29:20,407,"['Actually insane how Google is treated and insane how people sell this stock', 'I’m watching Costco trade at a relative 3x valuation to Google.

Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies. > The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said. > Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,yo2j3k,Meta Is Preparing to Notify Employees of Large-Scale Layoffs This Week,"Meta [US:META] Platforms Inc. is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be among the largest round in a recent spate of tech job cuts after the industry’s rapid growth during the pandemic. The layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as Wednesday, according to the people. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the people said. The planned layoffs would be the first broad headcount reductions to occur in the company’s 18-year history. While smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at Twitter Inc. this past week, which hit about half of that company’s staff, the number of Meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment. A spokesman for Meta declined to comment, referring The Wall Street Journal to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company would “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.” “So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,” he said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26. “In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.” The Journal reported in September that Meta was planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions. https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-is-preparing-to-notify-employees-of-large-scale-layoffs-this-week-11667767794?mod=hp_lead_pos1",rockinoutwith2,5209,2022-11-06 15:57:56,880,"['Meta had: \\- total number of employees in 2021 was 71,970, a 22.81% increase from 2020. \\-total number of employees in 2020 was 58,604, a 30.4% increase from 2019. \\-total number of employees in 2019 was 44,942, a 26.29% increase from 2018. \\-total number of employees in 2018 was 35,587, a 41.75% increase from 2017.', ""> “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Zuckerberg told employees at a companywide meeting at the end of June.

Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications. > Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said. > DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value. > David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities. > “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence. > In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",s1n0d3utscht3k,2359,2025-01-28 22:16:58,572,"['**User Report**| | | | :--|:--|:--|:-- **Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago **Total Comments** | 2607 | **Previous Best DD** | **Account Age** | 8 years | | [**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'openai after breaking every tos known to man:', '“You’re trying to kidnap what I’ve rightfully stolen” Princess Bride was ahead of it’s time', 'I love the idea they used ai to get more info from their ai to make their ai', ""lol, openAI steal other people's data.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1ib1a99,AI DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership,">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance. >Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. >“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.” >Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency. >Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office. >In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing. >Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea. >The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.” >Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations. >The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector. >The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities >The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access. >“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.” Link: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/nasdaq-futures-slump-as-china-s-deepseek-sparks-us-tech-concern](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/nasdaq-futures-slump-as-china-s-deepseek-sparks-us-tech-concern)",WinningWatchlist,870,2025-01-27 00:58:41,500,"['When did this news come out?

The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732786907971539235) (formerly Twitter) that he should be ""fired immediately"" and that Walt Disney himself is ""turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.""

The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were ""not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,"" according to AG Raúl Torrez. One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-companies-drop-ads-x-twitter-antisemitism-elon-musk-2023-11) after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11). Musk [chimed in](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732773421610606801) (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): ""Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy."" When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: ""He should be fired immediately."" He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: ""truth."" Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: [""Go fuck yourself.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-advertises-get-lost-twitter-dealbook-summit2023-11) At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out. ""Is that clear?"" Musk asked. ""I hope it is. Hey, Bob."" Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X. ""We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) or SpaceX or now X,"" Iger said. Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month. ""By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,"" Iger said. Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11) over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the ""absolute truth.""

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,sjdk9t,"FB is over, Metaverse won't save it","I've seen a lot of speculation on whether it's worth buying the dip on FB. Maybe it will bounce this week or next, but nobody, under any circumstances, should be long on FB. I work in tech, and my best estimation is that the Metaverse announcement was literally *because* FB could see the writing on the wall internally, and knew they were going to miss on earnings, so they had to create *some* narrative which would justify holding FB. Social networks have a couple important properties: 1. They're generational - people tend to use the network which their age cohort is using. The younger generation flocks to a new network during high-school age to avoid their parents, and then gradually the older generation starts to pile in. 2. They rely on network effects. There's always going to be at most a couple ""winners"" and everyone will move to those because a social network is worthless once people feel like that's not where the activity is. FB managed to stave off disaster and hold on to millennials buy buying Instagram, while keeping facebook.com as a high-profit environment where they could just bombard vulnerable old people and conspiracy theorists with high margin advertising (kind of like cable news). But they have failed to capture the younger generation who've moved to TikTok. And since there is only room for one mainstream social network for every generation, that leaves them with no real avenue for growth. So the metaverse is a totally impractical hail-marry. Basically what FB wants to convince you of is that they will be able to construct a compelling virtual reality and productize it faster than TikTok can eat their lunch. This is an extreme challenge for a number of reasons. The main one being: what they're describing is *incredibly* capital intensive. The amount of compute required to create a persistent interactive virtual reality for the entire world to play in is *orders of magnitude* higher than what's required to host images, videos and comments as they do now. Who's going to pay for that? Are advertisers going to pay 100x higher ad-rates to put up a billboard in a totally un-tested platform when they can just buy ads on TikTok instead? Maybe we'll get a metaverse someday, but at best it's decades away, and it's going to happen bottom-up from the expansion of MMO's and platforms like Roblox. It's not going to happen because a failing social network, with zero competency in the space, needs it to prop up their share price. edit: full disclosure: I own 10 shares of FB @ $350",pragmojo,7644,2022-02-03 02:56:52,1729,"['[deleted]', 'This would have a lot more credibility if you had posted before it shit the bed.', 'I work in tech...... as a cleaning lady', '“I work in tech,” LOL', '[deleted]']",wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjdk9t/fb_is_over_metaverse_wont_save_it/,Meta Platforms,2025-03-20 10:24:46.257270

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1iblv26,Nvidia’s $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE — Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%. The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. “Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”",s1n0d3utscht3k,1178,2025-01-27 17:18:07,191,"['**User Report**| | | | :--|:--|:--|:-- **Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago **Total Comments** | 2601 | **Previous Best DD** | **Account Age** | 8 years | | [**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'https://preview.redd.it/e4795or87mfe1.jpeg?width=3009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6812b82756f95decee26588a5dd389470405e1d1', 'There were signs https://preview.redd.it/7yg61hug8mfe1.jpeg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11bb2b6b910a6a492c88c3bb05e61bbd4a01ba85', 'This is the opening for anyone who missed the bull run on NVDA, so stop crying and load up.', ""It's so completely over the top.

Reddit,META,Meta Platforms,1b6agqo,Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming,"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app. Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged. This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU. The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store. Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.” Apple response: In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement. “The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement. “Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.” Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.” Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases. Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases. Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms. Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year. The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications. The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices. These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

You forbid companies from distributing apps outside the App Store, and then come in here claiming their success is because of the App Store. That seems rather dishonest.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,1ixzpoh,A closer look at Microsoft news – buy the AI dip?,"As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the ‘AI trade.’ I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions). **The FUD: ‘data center oversupply’** Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a “couple hundred MWs” of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent <5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‘oversupply’ and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down. [The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&opi=89978449) *“TD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'”* **The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?** First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute. **Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs. **Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up. **Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply. [Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) “Microsoft has **approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.” [OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners & Losers – SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser) “**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella [stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), “all I know is, I’m good for my $80B.” Microsoft’s recent [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is incrementally negative for Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.** “ “**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.” **AI continues advancements:** Anthropic’s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI’s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‘drop-in’ AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China). **TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,18fn1n6,I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Hello Readers, MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition. To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen. During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy. Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it. Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded. &#x200B;",MobyDick4Real_,2977,2023-12-11 00:16:48,645,"['**User Report**| | | | :--|:--|:--|:-- **Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago **Total Comments**|44|**Previous Best DD**| **Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.) >TL;DR: I think Microsoft is going to buy Lumen for their undersea cable access, and government contract wins.', 'Giving yourself that gold upvote means you must have some money.

Microsoft isn’t using electrons for the compute in this new chip; it’s using the Majorana particle that theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana described in 1937. Microsoft has reached this milestone by creating what it calls the “world’s first topoconductor,” a new type of material that can not only observe but also control Majorana particles to create more reliable qubits Microsoft has helped create a new material made from indium arsenide and aluminum, and it has placed eight topological qubits on a chip that it hopes can eventually scale to 1 million.

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,1id8ibz,Someone explain how Tesla went up and Microsoft went down?,"Tesla missed every mark, while Microsoft exceeded every mark. Genuinely how does this happend? i’m fairly new to stocks and trying to understand the ins and out of the marked. Can someone explain in a simple way why this happens?",Sup3rp1nk,1935,2025-01-29 18:53:00,742,"[""Stocks didn't feel like being rational in after hours, sometimes that gets fixed in regular. Sometimes not"", 'Vibes earnings will matter but it takes time.', 'Markets are forward looking and also irrational! Choose one or both', 'Sure. Stock price action from an earnings release is complex, but it all boils down to investor sentiment over the future of the financial outlook of the company. First of all, you have to gauge investor sentiment going into the earnings call. Are investors optimistic or pessimistic, regardless of the official ""marks"" as you say. MSFT stock action rose dramatically going from the drop Monday into earnings. TSLA dropped, pretty much below the Monday sell off level. So TSLA investor sentiment was poor, MSFT investor sentiment was bullish. Then you have to look at the marks themselves. They are based on some compilation of various professional analyst opinions, all written up and given for free... in other words, it\'s what they want you to see, it\'s isn\'t necessarily what they actually think. And Tesla already gave a Production and Delivery report in early January, which means that a slew of amateur analysts got within $0.01 of the report. Some people refer to this as the whisper number, or the marks that investors are actually expecting which differs from the FactSet compilation. Tesla pretty much nailed the whispers... I didn\'t check on Microsoft. You then have to factor in the trading positions, specifically the amount of shorting and the options open interest. The folks that are offside tomorrow will need to buy or sell their options, and the resulting delta hedging will move the stock. Options can have a huge impact on the short term price action, and the max pain level of this week for Tesla is $400, 362,472 call OI, 338,607 put OI, but given this week\'s price action, the calls have been already nuked pretty hard. For MSFT, max pain is $437.50, but here are big call OI spikes at $450 and above. So given the market positioning on options and whatever folks did on margin (owning common or shorting the stock), one then looks at the earnings results themselves. Does it differ from the actual investor expectations, regardless of the professional analysts? And very importantly, the future guidance/outlook... did anything change the investor story for the next quarter, year, or 5-10 years? Remember, the historical results are really only useful as a guide towards what it means for future results. If the future will knowingly or even speculatively differ from historical results, then the investor sentiment may not shift the way you may have expected given the historical results. If these things changed significantly, then you can have a major shift in the stock price, regardless of prior sentiment and positioning. But if it didn\'t, then the price action may be at the mercy of positioning. For Tesla, nothing much has changed in terms of what happened and investor\'s outlook on what is going to happen. So folks that bet on a story that turns out isn\'t true.. or not sufficiently true, especially those on margin or in options, will be forced to take action. This is how you get massive movements, when investors are forced by their prior investment decisions through margin, options, fear, and greed. But for Tesla this time, they were already down from the $480 highs in December, and investors are still looking forward to the upcoming product launches and FSD robotaxi availability which will affect revenue in a big way. For Microsoft, there\'s a bunch of shakiness with the whole Deepseek thing, and Azure cloud business is showing some issues. Very importantly, they gave a disappointing quarterly revenue forecast. That means there\'s really no catalyst for all those call options at $450 and above to be profitable, which means they will need to be sold tomorrow, which means the stock that is being held by the market maker in case they need to fulfill the call options gets released... basically delta hedging back to neutral, which means selling a lot of stock. And fundamentally, some folks may have wanted to get out with the Monday Deepseek thing and didn\'t - waiting on earnings. Then likely MSFT would have a bigger drop on Monday but didn\'t because folks were waiting to see at earnings. MSFT price action recovery was way higher than NVDA for instance. Now that earnings are out, folks might not have felt the need to hold MSFT for now, which reflects some risk off with the whole Chinese AI thing. Also, the investors that are in MSFT and that in TSLA have very different reasons for owning each. So how an earnings release affects their investor story is also going to be different. Furthermore, the reaction to an ER can twist and turn over many timeframes as data comes in, analysis is performed, and so forth. So initial reaction for TSLA was down - probably robots selling. Then it rose back up, as folks realized, nothing burger for earnings. Then we have the options effect tomorrow. It could easily be sold back down... and MSFT raised back up.', 'Tesla really makes you wonder what institutions are seeing and hearing to justify that multiple.']",stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1id8ibz/someone_explain_how_tesla_went_up_and_microsoft/,Microsoft,2025-03-20 10:26:11.609305
Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,1j09c5p,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago. >Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc. >Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May. >“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools. >Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users. >Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age. >It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one. >By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat. >Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients. >The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added. >At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure. >Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said. Link: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls) **My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",WinningWatchlist,2654,2025-02-28 09:47:56,299,"['I dont use skype, and there goes my 6 dollara skype credit for international calling', 'Man, Skype was the shit before Microsoft bought it.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,1divtu5,Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world. Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads. For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales. Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions. But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes. Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+. Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title. Nvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7. The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.

Cisco overtaking Microsoft ""certainly validates the networked economy that Cisco is revolutionising,"" said Brian Goodstadt, an analyst with the Standard & Poor Equity Group. Microsoft, while still a strong generator of corporate profits, generates much of its income from desktop applications and operating systems. While the Internet has boosted demand for Microsoft's products, Cisco, whose routers carry most of the traffic running over the network, is seen as a bigger beneficiary of its growth and its earnings gains have far outpaced Microsoft in recent quarters. Quite possibly, Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of equipment that powers the Internet, will become for the Internet what Microsoft Corp, the biggest software company, was for the personal computer. Judging by Cisco's market capitalisation, investors seem to believe that Cisco could become the technology standard bearer for Internet hardware. Microsoft, which was founded in 1975 and went public 11 years later, took 24 years to become the company investors value the most, but occupied that spot for less than one year. Analysts have said Cisco, which was founded in 1984 and went public in 1986, will likely remain top dog for much longer and has a shot at becoming the first firm ever to be worth $1 trillion.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,12zeetm,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/). The measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition. Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market. Microsoft could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform, Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the space, the CMA said. Cloud gaming is a technology that enables gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a mainstream way of playing games. Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content offerings. However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms. [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase. The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms. Microsoft argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms. Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same features. Sony still opposes the deal. The CMA had raised concerns with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release. Cloud gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic in 2022. Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries. Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report. Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground.

When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.” Business Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday. The job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information. Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%. Microsoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts. In early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap. As 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year. Over the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month. Meanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.” Microsoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.

Company I work for adopted a bell curve with 10% top performers and 10% bottom performers one year, and the bottom performers got laid off on a re-org. They\'re flashing the same bell curve this year. It\'s basically a threat to employees. From an employee perspective it turns your place into hunger games. It\'s no longer ""worker against the work"", it\'s ""worker against worker"". Instead of comparing the employee to the work they were supposed to do and how well they should do it, everyone worker is lined up in a long line and the last 10% are handed pink slips. All this does is promote back-stabbing, kissing up, etc even more. Slackers will redouble efforts to take credit for someone elses work. Ass kissers will do what they must to ensure their boss thinks they\'re a star performer. Lots of good workers who are quiet, and just keep their heads down and get the real work done will get thrown under the bus. It harkens back to ""lines of code"" and other BS things management does. Performance reviews are often filled with subjective BS so the HR dept, company and manager can grade you however they want anyways. So, again, it\'s really just a popularity contest, and the bottom 10% of people at work that are ugly, lack social skills or don\'t socialize enough to brag about their work end up getting the boot. This especially bites companies in the rear when they have an entrenched culture that watches each others backs. There will be some minority group that gets targeted for layoffs first even though they are good performers. What you do year over year is just end up concentrating more and more of a ""good old boys"" shop, and star talent that isn\'t let in moves on.', 'Working in tech is literally the hunger games right now.

Then, and only then, will they consider bringing someone that can “rebuild the engineering teams” at any cost.

Reddit,MSFT,Microsoft,14k8vwr,"Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar","* Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month. * Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options. * Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge. Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday. The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16. The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million. Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively. First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks. Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act. Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress. Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died. Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector. For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon. However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge. OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.",No_Cow1,2438,2023-06-27 05:34:17,382,"['I am tired of this shit.

Reddit,NVDA,Nvidia,1if2ukg,Do you think it's time to sell NVDA?,"The introduction of Deepseek probably doesn't warrant the sharp stock decline value of NVDA, that is understandable. But so is their stock value rise for the past 2 years. To put it in other words, yes the decline was a result of a hype, but so was the rise. Something that didn't make much sense got replaced by another thing that doesn't make much sense. At the end of the day, Nvidia is a great company that sells the best computer chips and GPU's, but that's all there is to it. I just don't see how they can rise again for the foreseeable future. They've hit a peak point in my opinion. And while Deepseek's introduction shouldn't have been the reason for their stock decline vlue, it was just a trigger for something that was in my opinion inevitable. I was pressured by family members into buying NVDA, and now the total loss is about 13.5% of its original price. I feel like I should just close the position as I just don't see how it can rise again for me to recoup the losses, but I also don't want to do something based on feelings. I hope someone in this subreddit can help. I try to do some due diligence and understand metrics, but I'm no expert and I'm finding it difficult to put the time into learning these things with my very demanding fulltime job, which is why I usually stick with low risky ETF's, except for Nvidia which I was kinda pressured into buying, and I was worried that it might become even more profitable and then hearing ""I told you so!"".",CarefulScreen9459,0,2025-02-01 04:33:36,66,"[""I don't think it is a sell but growth will slow down considerably, this is not a $100B company anymore, we're looking at a $3T giant, it is basically impossible to grow fast at this valuation.

Reddit,NVDA,Nvidia,1ib9u95,NVDA’s DeepSeek Sell-Off: This Is a Jevons Paradox Buying Opportunity,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is down hard, dropping from $142 to $126 pre-market after hype around DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup achieving more with less compute. The market fears efficient AI models will hurt GPU demand, but this reaction misses the bigger picture. Why This Is Bullish Long-Term 1. Jevons Paradox: Efficiency doesn’t reduce demand—it increases it. As AI becomes cheaper and more accessible, more businesses, startups, and individuals will adopt it, driving more GPU sales. 2. New Markets: Efficient models mean more local AI deployments (edge computing) and new industries adopting AI. NVIDIA’s products (DGX, Jetson, RTX GPUs) are perfectly positioned for this shift. 3. Redistribution, Not Decline: The demand for AI is evolving, not shrinking. NVIDIA will sell to thousands of smaller players, adding to their hyperscaler business. 4. Software Moat: CUDA and TensorRT ensure NVIDIA stays at the center of AI workflows, even as the market shifts. At $126, this is classic overreaction. AI isn’t slowing—it’s expanding. NVDA is still the backbone of the industry, and this dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors. TL;DR: DeepSeek highlights AI’s growth, not NVIDIA’s decline. Efficiency drives broader adoption, and NVDA’s hardware/software dominance makes them a winner. Thoughts? Buying the dip? Update: NVDA dropped to $116.94 at its lowest point today. Making it the largest one day drop of any stock, almost 600 Billion.

Maybe it\'s because you were a regular on r/wallstreetbets back in the 1770\'s. ""I\'m bearish on the coal market"", people would say. I believe the front page of the London Financial Guide at the time read ""YOLO coal puts"". If r/wallstreetbets was around at that time, I\'m sure everyone would be selling their coal mine stocks. Right at the beginning of the industrial revolution. What I\'m trying to say, is that more efficient use of coal did not mean that less coal was used. In fact the exact opposite is what happened. Nvidia isn\'t selling steam. They\'re not selling steam engines. They are selling coal. If someone can exploit coal more efficiently, that just opens up more things you can use coal for. And if you got a big fuckoff giant steam engine, you can now do things with coal nobody thought possible. Anyway, buy the dip.

Reddit,NVDA,Nvidia,1awompn,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so he'll wipe my ass,"TL;DR: my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4,000 $NVDA shares (1,000 shares pre 4:1 split) in 2018/2019 and am now sitting on >$2.5 million in NVDA. I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids. I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers. Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares. I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about. He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”. Thought id share here because I’m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub.

Reddit,NVDA,Nvidia,1djm92c,NVIDIA Will Crash,"So one thing that most people agree on is that Nvidia is the one benefitting from this Gold Rush ( AI Boom) being the most dominant player selling shovels ( GPU's). But my thesis is that this AI Boom isn't sustainable for long since it is not only expensive to afford the infrastructure for machine learning( data centres etc) but also time consuming to train the machines with a googol of information. Now, the problem is that currently there aren't meaningful profitable applications for these AI, especially generative AI which all the companies seem to be hopping on now just for the sake of it. It would make sense if they used this AI to enhance their products which many are but offerring generative AI as a service directly to the consumers still seems to be somewhat precarious. Most common people don't care about AI. The problem that most people are callous about is the over dependence of NVIDIA on this Generative AI Boom to the point where more than 60% of their revenue comes from the data centre/AI segment. Once the AI Boom fizzles out in the future (which I think is still far away), their revenue will take a hit severely and you'll just get a bunch of analysts at wall street filled with gloom just because the revenue doesn't match their expectations. As a result, the stock would take a hit. Remember, NVIDIA might still be incredibly profitable after that and bring in significant revenue especially through their leadership in the gaming segment. However it will lose its former glory and it's stock price would come crashing down. It needs to diversify soon and keep it as its top priority. Please give me your two cents on this and correct me if I'm wrong . NOTE: Do your own Research and Analysis before investing. Don't invest just on the basis of a reddit post. This isn't no investment advice. Edit : The title may be a bit misleading, my apologies. I'm not saying NVIDIA as a company would crash, but its stock price will be severely affected once the AI Boom fizzles out and its revenue reduces , Although I don't think it'll happen in the near future.",ZucchiniOk2875,34,2024-06-19 11:40:10,336,"['NVIDIA will crash the moment I invest in it.', 'The fact that some people still think it will crash convinces me that the top is still not in lol', 'Why do I get the impression that there are people who jerk off to the thought of NVIDIA crashing.', ""I think you are wrong.

Reddit,NVDA,Nvidia,1inb7p0,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think. Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags: 📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend. 🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation. 🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme. 🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates. ⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation. 🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road. 🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse. 🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress. 🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead. Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous. What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",rairiig,3342,2025-02-11 17:20:13,605,"['I know Tesla is about to crash because I had a Tesla recruiter reach out to me with a job opportunity.

He always had fanatic followers and his recent political revelations are just emboldening them. I do think there's a clear conflict between republican political support and buying EVs though. However, given his position of power we'll likely see more efforts to destroy other EVs (as we've already seen cutting funding for charging networks), rather than efforts to prop up Tesla. But is that enough? Idk, I can't see myself ever buying a tesla now, and if other EVs are targeted by a biased administration the obvious choice is to go hybrid, today's plug-in hybrids are great and can cover many people's commutes just on their electric motors alone So it seems like the writing is on the wall, but it's been like that for years. Can't assume the market will behave rationally or Tesla would've been dethroned a long long time ago.

I closed them and eventually entered back in aggressively starting 20 days ago when the stock price was at $350/share. I've officially closed my puts, most recently holding 325x $200p Aug 15 puts. Today alone, I made $396k from the TSLA puts. Other notable plays was $100k of $QBTS while it was under $1/share after I read an article about Chinese researchers cracking encryption using their tech. I made around $300k before closing my position. Fidelity is a great platform, but their charting takes 24 hours to update and they remove gain/loss if you close the position completely, but you can see my performance in the below pictures. As a side note, the massive decline in November was associated with IWM puts that got massively underwater from the Trump pump.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1j7l0bv,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did... Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M. I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%! Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet. Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today.

Do not buy the dip! https://moneycheck.com/tesla-tsla-stock-trumps-purchase-fails-to-sustain-rally/ Tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years. The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump’s public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk. Despite the recent uptick, Tesla stock remains down almost 50% from its mid-December record high.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1j3ibxk,Elon Musk tries and fails to pump Tesla’s stock (TSLA),"Elon Musk tried to pump Tesla’s stock (TSLA) by claiming a 10x increase in profits, but it failed. In fact, the stock is down 10% since Musk’s pump. After an analyst posted a prediction that Tesla would increase its profits by 256%, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded >It will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1gai1a7,$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime.,"Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later). 2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event. 3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? *15 fucking times*. You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. *note*: This is NOT financial advice.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1fnzywr,Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere.,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon. But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1grqiw1,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs. 2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"". 3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity. 4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales. 5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete. 6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat. 7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share. 8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla. 9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader. 10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow. 11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created. Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1i7gq5j,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion AI project Trump announced, claiming its backers don’t ‘have the money’","https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/tech/elon-musk-trump-stargate-openai/index.html > Shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House, “First Buddy” Elon Musk tried to tear it down. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.” > Trump said the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement. Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. > Perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative. Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement. Musk, who has said he “doesn’t trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don’t necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.",WickedSensitiveCrew,5255,2025-01-22 12:34:46,577,"['Hi, you\'re on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific. **To everyone commenting:** Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Reddit,TSLA,Tesla,1imaowd,Why is Tesla stocks not collapsing? (Genuine question),"Hi everyone, I hope some of you can shed light on this question. I’m really curious why and how Tesla stock continues to hold its value, given that the company’s sales are relatively low right now and its growth seems slower than expected. It also appears that the Cybertruck launch didn’t go as planned, and Elon’s increasingly controversial presence might not be the best for the company, since he’s such a key part of its marketing. Am I missing something here? Is there something I’m overlooking? (Just to clarify, this isn’t coming from a political standpoint, I’m genuinely curious.)",Intelligent_Finger88,2367,2025-02-10 11:51:10,1392,"['There is an investing aphorism that markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Reddit can be an echo chamber and not real life. 2. Despite reddit\'s hatred of it, the Cybertruck outsold all other electric trucks...so real life consumers seemed to prefer it (over EV trucks anyways). 3. Tesla is ahead of many US EV makers in many ways, and both US political parties strongly favor EV tariffs which limits competition they\'d otherwise have to face in this market. (Trump tariffs are talked about a lot, but the previous administration actually put 100% EV tariffs into place/quadrupling the Trump tariffs). 4. Him being the richest person while also being presumably in the president\'s good favor has the potential for him to make moves that benefit himself and the company (I\'m not saying I agree with it, I\'m just saying he\'s in a potential position of power to potentially influence things in his favor). 5. People have been saying Tesla was overvalued since it went public. Not saying that it isn\'t...but people have been saying it\'ll collapse for over a decade now. Betting against Tesla can be risky business. As far as sales go, they just refreshed their most popular model (Model Y). Currently selling as a jacked up price foundation series with FSD, but there\'s a good chance plenty of people are/were waiting for the refresh, and potentially waiting for it to come out at a normal price (not ""foundation series with FSD"" That\'s just speculation on my part though. I do agree with the last part...I think Elon is in fact, alienating a lot of his customer base...I kind of hate that EVs and Tesla became political in the first place.
